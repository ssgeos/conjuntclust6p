# conjuntclust6p-2000-2024
statistics with dense planetary conjunction clusters each containing at least 6 conjunctions from 2000 to 2024

We share the statistical relationship between clusters of planetary conjunctions (involving at least six conjunctions) and major earthquakes (M ≥ 7.0) from 2000 to 2024 (9132 days). Using data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), we identified 371 M 7.0+ earthquakes over this period. Six conjunction clusters, each spanning a maximum of 2 days, were analyzed with an extended time window of -3 to +5 days. All six clusters were associated with at least one M 7.0+ earthquake within their respective windows. A binomial test, based on a null hypothesis of no association (with a background probability of 0.306245 for at least one earthquake in a 9-day window), yielded a p-value of 0.00082493 (0.0082493%), indicating a statistically significant association.

Planetary conjunction data were sourced using the Solpage app (https://ssgeos/org/solpage.htm), a tool designed for calculating celestial alignments and their clustering. These data can be very easily (visually) verified with independent apps such as Solar System Scope (https://www.solarsystemscope.com) A planetary conjunction is defined as the moment when two celestial bodies reach the exact same longitude relative to a centric body, with NO angular tolerance. For example, a Mercury-Venus-Neptune conjunction indicates that Venus and Neptune share the same longitude as observed from a Mercury-centric perspective. We identified clusters of conjunctions, defined as a sequence of at least six conjunctions occurring within a 1–2 day period. A total of six such clusters were identified in the years 2000, 2003, 2007, 2010 (two clusters), and 2019.

Expanding to a larger dataset (1940–2024), we identified a total of 31 clusters, with 25 of 29 independent trials (after merging some overlapping clusters) associated with at least one M 6.5+ earthquake. A binomial test produced a p-value of 0.004794 (0.4794%), and a Poisson rate test comparing earthquake rates during cluster windows to the background rate showed a 54.8% increase (p-value = 0.004016). These findings indicate that dense planetary conjunction clusters are associated with increased seismic activity in the surrounding days.

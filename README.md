# conjuntclust6p
statistics with dense planetary conjunction clusters each containing at least 6 conjunctions

We share our results of the statistical relationship between clusters of planetary conjunctions (involving at least six conjunctions) and major earthquakes (M ≥ 7.0) from 2000 to 2024. Using data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), we identified 371 M 7.0+ earthquakes over this period. Six conjunction clusters, each spanning 1–2 days and involving 5–8 planets, were analyzed with an extended time window of -3 to +5 days. All six clusters were associated with at least one M 7.0+ earthquake within their respective windows. A binomial test, based on a null hypothesis of no association (with a background probability of 0.306245 for at least one earthquake in a 9-day window), yielded a p-value of 0.00082493 (0.0082493%), indicating a statistically significant association.

Planetary conjunction data were sourced using the Solpage app (https://ssgeos/org/solpage.htm), a tool designed for calculating celestial alignments and their clustering. These data can be very easily verified with independent apps such as Solar System Scope (https://www.solarsystemscope.com) A planetary conjunction is defined as the moment when two celestial bodies reach the exact same longitude relative to a centric body, with NO angular tolerance. For example, a Mercury-Venus-Neptune conjunction indicates that Venus and Neptune share the same longitude as observed from a Mercury-centric perspective. We identified clusters of conjunctions, defined as a sequence of at least six conjunctions occurring within a 1–2 day period. A total of six such clusters were identified in the years 2000, 2003, 2007, 2010 (two clusters), and 2019.
